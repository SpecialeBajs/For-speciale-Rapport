\section{Method}
This section describes LightGCN, NGCF and price-aware recommendation.
The difference between these recommendation models are described with focus on the adjacency matrix and the embeddings.
An attempt at implementing price aware recommendation in LightGCN and NGCF is also attempted, where the focus is on changing the input parameters.
