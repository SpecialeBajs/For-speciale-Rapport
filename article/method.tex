\section{Method}\label{sec:method}
This section describes LightGCN, NGCF and PUP.
The difference between these recommendation models are described with focus on the adjacency matrix and the embeddings.
We describe the implementation for our hypothesis in the following section.
Our hypothesis is: Changing the input parameters to include price and categories for LightGCN and NGCF it will model price-aware recommendation through convolutions and thereby achieve more precise recommendation.
% An attempt at implementing price aware recommendation in LightGCN and NGCF is described, where the focus is on changing the input parameters.
