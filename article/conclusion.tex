\section{Conclusion}
In this research paper we investigated some state-of-the-art GCN recommendation methods for collaborative filtering.
We focused on LightGCN, NGCF, and PUP, where we described differences in the construction of the adjacency matrices and the differences in the construction of the embeddings.
\\
One of our early hypotheses was that by simply changing the input we could achieve a higher precision.
Inspired by the PUP method we extended the LightGCN and NGCF methods with price and category as additional side information.
The methods were changed to test the effect of price and category as input values.
This showed that only adding this data to the adjacency matrices was not sufficient to increase the performance of these methods and actually made them perform worse.
\\
We conducted experiments which showed that LightGCN outperforms other methods such as PUP and NGCF.
However, the extensions LightGCN- and NGCF-PAS showed that NGCF is better suited for handling additional side information, where LightGCN currently does not handle additional side information well.
\\
Our plans for the master thesis are to continue working with LightGCN, NGCF, and PUP and to explore the hypotheses we developed.
