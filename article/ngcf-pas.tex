\subsection{Simple price aware extension of NGCF}
To gain an understanding of the effect of feature transformation and nonlinear activation functions a price aware extension has also been added to NGCF.
The embeddings for users and price are calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        E^{(l)} = &LeakyReLU((\lambda + I)E^{(l-1)}W_1^{(l)}+\\
        & \lambda E^{(l-1)}\bigodot E^{(l-1)}W_2^{(l))},
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $E^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{I+U+C+P \times T}$ are the item, user, price, and category embedding after $l$ convolutions.
$E^{(0)} \in \mathbb{R}^{I+U+C+P \times T}$ is the $0th$ layer embedding, where $T$ is the embedding size.
$I$ is the identity matrix.
$W_1^{(l)}$ and $W_2^{(l)}$ are trainable weight matrices.
$\lambda$ is the Laplacian matrix for the user-item, item-price and item-category graph, and is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda = D^{\frac{1}{2}}AD^{\frac{1}{2}},
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $D$ are the adjacency and diagonal matrix, which were constructed as in \autoref{subsec:simple-extension}.
