\section{Equal data}
When measuring the performance of the different methods it is essential that the datasets are the same.
Without them being equal the results of the experiments wont be worth comparing.
Both Price Aware and Light GCN utilized the yelp dataset according to their papers.
We did not get the dataset from the Price Aware implementation and were unable to find the original yelp-2018 dataset from the Light GCN implementation were the price and category was still attached.
We therefore decided to utilize the yelp-2020 dataset, in which users rank businesses between 1 to 5 starts.
Inspired by the Price Aware method we also decided to only use businesses with the restaurant category.
What is left is set of businesses with one or more subcategories that relate to what type of restaurant they are.
Like Price Aware we cut of any extra subcategories so that each business now only has one subcategory, which we will refer to as the item's category from now on.
\\
Price Aware has a 60\% training-, 20\% validation- and 20\% test-data split while Light GCN has a 70\% training-, 10\% validation-, and 20\% test-data split.
It was decided to use the Light GCN split since this was the method we planned to extend.
\\
After this we now have a dataset that can be used to compare the different methods with or without category and price.
