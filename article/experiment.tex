\section{Simple price aware extension of LightGCN}
To see the extension of LightGCN, we compare Price-Aware Recommendation, LightGCN and the adapted LightGCN with Price and category nodes in the input data. 
The hyperparameter $X$ is tested with the values of $0.0$, $0.5$, $1.0$ and $2.0$ to see the effect of this as input data has on the final result.
The larger the hyperparameters value is, the larger effect the nodes of category and price would have on the final result.
