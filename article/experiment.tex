\section{Experiment}\label{sec:experiment}
The experiments are conducted on a Yelp Dataset to evaluate our proposed changes in LightGCN and NGCF.
To test our hypothesis defined in \autoref{sec:method} we intend to answer the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item RQ1: How does our extensions of LightGCN and NGCF perform compared to other state-of-the-art methods?
    \item RQ2: How will changing the input value for price and category affect the results?
\end{itemize}
