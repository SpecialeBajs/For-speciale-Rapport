\section{Future work}
For our master thesis we will continue to explore recommendation systems and continue in the path of LightGCN and Price-aware recommendation.
There are several topics related to these implementation to be investigated to gain a better understanding of how recommender systems can be improved.
The hypothesis for the master thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding price and category embeddings to LightGCN will improve performance of the simple price aware extension.
    \item If adding price and category embeddings improves the performances, then it can get generalized to include other features than price and category.
    \item Price-aware recommendation can be generalized so other features can get integrated to improve the recommendation performance.
\end{itemize}
