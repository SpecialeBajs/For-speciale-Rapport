\subsection{LightGCN and NGCF}\label{subsec:lightgcn-ngcf}
In LightGCN Xiangnan et al. investigate the effect of feature transformation and nonlinear activation functions within collaborative filtering using NGCF \cite{lightgcn}.
NGCF is a framework developed by Wang et al. \cite{NGCF_2019} that utilizes a Graph Neural Network with three components in the framework: (1) an embedding layer that constructs initial user - and item embeddings; (2) embedding propagation layers that capture CF with the two operations of message construction and message aggregation; (3) a prediction layer that concatenates the embeddings at each layer for each user and for each item such that $e_{u}^{(*)} = e_{u}^{(0)}||...||e_{u}^{(l)}$ and $e_{i}^{(*)} = e_{i}^{(0)}||...||e_{i}^{(l)}$ where $u$ indicates the user, $i$ indicates the item, $e$ is the embedding and $l$ is the layer \cite{NGCF_2019}.
Within the second component of message construction the message embedding is implemented as:
\begin{equation}
    m_{u \leftarrow i} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|\mathcal{N}_u||\mathcal{N}_i|}}(W_1e_i + W_2(e_i \odot e_u)),
    \label{eq:message-construction}
\end{equation}
where $W_1$ and $W_2 \in R^{d' \times d}$ are weight matrices, $d$ is the embedding size and $d'$ is the transformation size.
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{|\mathcal{N}_u||\mathcal{N}_i|}}$ is the graph Laplacian norm, where $\mathcal{N}_u$ and $\mathcal{N}_i$ are the set of neighbors of user $u$ and item $i$.
This is done with the purpose of calculating how much the item contributes to the users preference \cite{NGCF_2019}.
LightGCN criticize the use of the weight matrices $W_1$ and $W_2$ as not being useful for CF as each user-item interaction graph only has the ID as input and it has no semantic value \cite{lightgcn}.
Also within the second component the message aggregation is implemented as:
\begin{equation}
    e_{u}^{(l)} = \mbox{LeakyReLU}(m^{(l)}_{u \leftarrow u} + \sum^{}_{i \in \mathcal{N}} m^{(l)}_{u \leftarrow i}),
\end{equation}
where $e_{u}^{(l)}$ is the embedding of user $u$ at layer $l$.
LeakyReLU is the nonlinear activation function used in NGCF to allow encoding positive and small negative signals.
LightGCN shows that NGCF will perform better if the feature transformation is removed, and that the activation function has small effect when feature transformation is included, but if feature transformation is disabled the activation function will have a negative impact on performance.
LightGCN also shows that NGCF will significantly improve if both the activation function and feature transformation are removed \cite{lightgcn}.
