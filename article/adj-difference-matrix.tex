\section{Generated adjacency matrix}
In the following subsection the generated adjacency matrices of LightGCN and price aware recommendation are described.
Both use the adjacency matrix as a representation for a heterogeneous graph, where the value 1 represent a connection between two nodes.
A more detailed description of the implementation can be seen in \ref{app:adj-impl}.

\subsection{LightGCN}
The adjacency matrix of LightGCN is as follows:
\begin{gather}
    A =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0   & R \\
        R^T & 0
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{gather}
where $R \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$, and $M$ and $N$ denotes the number of users and the number of items summed together.
Each entry in $R_{ui}$ is inserted with 1, if there is a connection between user $u$ and item $i$.

\subsection{Price-aware recommendation}
The adjacency matrix of Price-aware recommendation is as follows:
\begin{gather}
    A =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0   & R \\
        R^T & 0
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{gather}
where $R \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$, and $M$ and $N$ denotes the number of users, number of items, number of categories, and number of prices summed together.
Each entry in $R_{ui}$, $R_{ip}$, $R_{ic}$ is inserted with 1 if there is a connection either between user $u$ and item $i$, item $i$ and price $p$ or item $i$ and category $c$.
